Followupapp is a lightweight, front-end-only demo for tracking follow-up tasks and reminders. It runs entirely in the browser and uses static demo data to illustrate the UI and interactions.

Open locally
1. Open `admin.html` or `store-manager.html` directly in your browser (double-click it or use File → Open).
2. No build step or server is required.

Key files
- `admin.html`: Admin workspace markup and app container.
- `store-manager.html`: Store manager workspace markup and app container.
- `styles.css`: Global styles and layout for the UI.
- `admin.js`: Client-side behavior and demo data handling for the admin view.
- `store-manager.js`: Client-side behavior and demo data handling for the store manager view.

Limitations
- Static demo data only (no persistence).
- No backend/API; everything runs in the browser.
