Followupapp is a lightweight, front-end-only demo for tracking follow-up tasks and reminders. It runs entirely in the browser and uses static demo data to illustrate the UI and interactions.

Open locally
1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click it or use File → Open).
2. No build step or server is required.

Key files
- `index.html`: Main page markup and app container.
- `styles.css`: Global styles and layout for the UI.
- `app.js`: Client-side behavior and demo data handling.
- `store-manager-test.html`: Store manager workspace with a preloaded admin-linked test profile.
- `build-package.md`: Packaging/build notes for distributing the static app.

Tests and fixtures
- `tests/fixtures/`: Mock audit/task data fixtures.
- `tests/validate-fixtures.mjs`: Minimal fixture validation script.
- `tests/README.md`: How to run fixture checks and manual QA.

Limitations
- Static demo data only (no persistence).
- No backend/API; everything runs in the browser.
